Weather rainbow
=====================

Weather rainbow is a simple application using AngularJS that visually shows you the weather temperature using colours as well as numbers. This is just a fun little project to see whether we visualise and understand the temperature better using a colour than if we had just read the temperature.

### How to run

1. `git clone` repo
2. `npm install` to get the node_modules
3. open up the `index.html` in a browser

The app gets its live data from the [open weather map](http://openweathermap.org/api).
