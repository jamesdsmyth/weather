Lets grow
=====================

A simple weather app using AngularJS that visually shows you the weather temperature using colours instead of numbers. This is just a fun little project to see whether we visualise and understand the temperature better using a colour than if we had just read the temperature.

### How to run

1. `git clone` repo
2. `npm install` to get the node_modules
3. open up the `index.html`

The app gets its live data from the [open weather map](http://openweathermap.org/api).
